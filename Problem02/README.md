# BackTracking-Popeye-And-Olive
A simple game in which Popeye tries to find Olive who is lost in a maze. Not many people know that Popeye was an awesome programmer and here he uses a trick called BackTracking to find and rescue his beloved Olive.

Platform:
--------
Linux

Prerequisite:
-------------
Python3

Output:
--------
For every iteration, the program show the current position of Popeye, the direction he moves from his last location and the path he has travelled from the beginning of his journey. The path of his journey is shown by asterisks('*'). In case Popeye hits a dead end, the program shows "Backtracking..." on the console.

Usage:
------

```
python3 Olive_Popeye.py
```

You can try out new mazes by editing the file named "matrix.txt". Use the character hash("#") for wall, dot/period(".") for road, Capital "P" (NATO phonetic Papa) for Popeye and Capital "O" (NATO phonetic Oscar) for Olive. Remember that your matrix file should be present in the same directory as the python script.
